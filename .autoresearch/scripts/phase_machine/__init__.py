"""phase_machine package — facade over four single-concern submodules.

Dependency direction (top depends on lower):
    guidance, phase_policy
        → validators
            → state_store

This `__init__.py` re-exports the public surface; new code may import
directly from the submodule (`from phase_machine.state_store import ...`).
`auto_rollback` lives in git_utils and is re-exported here for callers
that still import it from phase_machine.
