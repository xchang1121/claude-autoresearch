"""Phase rules + bash/edit gates + transition logic.

Bash gate is three layers, each with one job:

  1. CLASSIFIER (`classify`) — pure function: command string → CommandShape.
       AR(name)   canonical `.autoresearch/scripts/<name>.py` invocation
       LIFECYCLE  AR but lifecycle (dashboard / parse_args / scaffold /
                  resume), allowed in every phase
       READONLY   every chain segment is read-only (ls / cat / git read /
                  echo / pwd / ...). NO file redirects, NO mutations.
       OTHER      anything else (ad-hoc bash, malformed AR, writes)
     Consults command text only — no phase, no filesystem.

  2. PHASE TABLE — `_AR_ALLOWED_BY_PHASE` / `_OTHER_ALLOWED_BY_PHASE`.
     Static dicts. LIFECYCLE / READONLY are implicitly allowed everywhere.
     A rule change is a one-row edit.

  3. `check_bash` — global string bans, classify(), table lookup.

The Edit/Write gate (`check_edit`) and phase-transition logic
(`compute_next_phase` / `compute_resume_phase`) live below.

# normalization).

# the post-restructure layout (engine/ holds blessed CLIs like
# pipeline.py / baseline.py / create_plan.py / parse_args.py) and the
# top-level lifecycle scripts (dashboard.py, scaffold.py, resume.py)
