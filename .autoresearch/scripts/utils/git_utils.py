"""Shared git helpers for autoresearch lifecycle code.

scaffold and hook_post_edit both need to commit files inside a task's git
repo. Historically each path open-coded its own `subprocess.run(["git", ...])`
sequence, with subtly different error-handling — scaffold used `check=True`
(crash loud on any git failure) while hook_post_edit's `_commit_seed`
swallowed every error as a stderr WARNING and let phase advance anyway.

The latter caused a class of bugs where the seed kernel never made it into
HEAD, baseline ran fine on the in-tree code, phase walked forward, and the
problem only surfaced two phases later as a misleading "uncommitted changes
from previous round" block in `_edit_phase_git_gate`.

This module is the single canonical implementation of "stage these files
and commit". Both scaffold and hook_post_edit now route through it. The
contract:

    ok, info = commit_in_task(task_dir, paths, message)
        ok   == True  → either created a commit (info=short hash) or there
                        was nothing to commit (info="noop"); both safe to
                        proceed.
        ok   == False → commit really failed (info = human-readable cause).
                        Caller decides whether to abort, hold phase, or
                        propagate.

Defensive `git config user.name/email` runs every call so we don't depend
on `.git/config` having been set by an earlier path. Repeated config sets
are idempotent.
