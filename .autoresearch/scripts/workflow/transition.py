"""PhaseController — single owner of .ar_state/.phase writes.

Before this module, write_phase was called from 12 sites across
hook_post_bash, hook_post_edit, pipeline.py, and _baseline_init.
Each site embedded its own decision logic (read progress, inspect
files, branch on subagent state, ...). When phase rules drifted in one
place they didn't drift in the others, which is how
GENERATE_KERNEL-vs-BASELINE retry behaviour got tangled.

PhaseController takes EVENTS as input (what just happened) and is the
only thing that decides the target phase + writes it. Callers no longer
do `write_phase(...)` directly; they do `PhaseController(td).on_xxx()`.
The set of events here is exhaustive for the current call sites, by
design: a new event has to land here, not in the caller.
